### Project Management
The project is divided into features, or tasks. We will manage tasks using the following Trello board: [http://go.osu.edu/cse5524](http://go.osu.edu/cse5524). Each task will have its own card on the Trello board. 

### Team Member Contribution

2. When complete, make a pull request on your branch.
3. Put the corresponding Trello card under the "Pull Request" list and tag the usernames of other team members.
4. Team members will comment on the Github pull request to suggest revisions.
5. Once approved, merge the branch with the master branch.
