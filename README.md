# Optical Character Recognition

## Project Proposal

Subject to change.

#### Description
1. Create set of training data for Latin characters based on the Arial font.
2. Create testing data consisting of handwritten Latin characters.
3. Develop algorithm that compares testing data to training data to identify characters.
4. Develop test script that returns accuracy of character recognition.

**Additional Constraints** 
- Words must be in English.

**Stretch Goals** 
- Translate words into different languages.
- Synthesize speech from words.

#### Evaluation
Number of characters correctly recognized.

#### Division of Tasks
**Kyla**
- Create training data. 
- Write algorithm to read training data and detect features and patterns and so forth.
- Write script to evaluate correctness.

**Edrienne**
- Create testing data. 
- Write algorithm to read testing data and handle imperfections in test data to feed into evaluator.
- Write script to evaluate correctness.

**Yash**
- Write algorithm that does feature detection/matching on testing data to check what characters are.
- Anything else.

## Workflow

#### Project Management
The project is divided into features, or tasks. We will manage tasks using the following Trello board: [http://go.osu.edu/cse5524](http://go.osu.edu/cse5524). Each task will have its own card on the Trello board. 

#### Team Member Contribution
1. Create a branch when working on your task. 
2. When complete, make a pull request on your branch.
3. Put the corresponding Trello card under the "Pull Request" list and tag the usernames of other team members.
4. Team members will comment on the Github pull request to suggest revisions.
5. Once approved, merge the branch with the master branch.

#### Other Guidelines
- Make sure to have good descriptions for your commits. 
- Comments are appreciated.
- Balance code readability with concision.
