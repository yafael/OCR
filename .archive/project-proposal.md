## Project Proposal

### Description
1. Create set of training data for Latin characters based on the Arial font.
2. Create testing data consisting of handwritten Latin characters.
3. Develop algorithm that compares testing data to training data to identify characters.
4. Develop test script that returns accuracy of character recognition.

#### Additional Constraints
- Words must be in English.

#### Stretch Goals
- Translate words into different languages.
- Synthesize speech from words.

#### Evaluation
Number of characters correctly recognized.

### Division of Tasks
#### Kyla
- Create training data. 
- Write algorithm to read training data and detect features and patterns and so forth.
- Write script to evaluate correctness.

#### Edrienne
- Create testing data. 
- Write algorithm to read testing data and handle imperfections in test data to feed into evaluator.
- Write script to evaluate correctness.

#### Yash
- Write algorithm that does feature detection/matching on testing data to check what characters are.
- Anything else.
